# PollinationRobot
A hardware based system designed to identify chilli flowers and move a robotic arm to its location to pollinate it

Unfortunately, the code I have written for this is lost due to the fact that it was written on a raspberry pi a long time ago, and the SD card containing all the information is nowhere to be found.
